# Lecture 4 - User Research Methods.

- Things to remember.
    - User research needs to be done but should be **done right.**
    - We briefly discussed a number of methods to help conduct user research
    - Make sure you understand the differences between these terms: foundational research, tactical (design) research, post-launch research, primary research, secondary research, quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis.
    - In this lecture, we focus on some details of the most common user research methods
- General Tips for various research methods.
    - The key is that user research should be **planned ahead**.
    - For example, in a user interview, effort should be exerted before the interview to write a script of the questions, not just ask random questions at the time of interview.
    - Planning ahead does not mean to be strict, flexibility is required during the activity (script is not a bible).
    - Different methods are not alternatives in a one step process, use a **combination of methods (Survey, Focus Groups, Interview, etc.)** in a relevant order.
    - **Testing** and **iteration** is your way to improve any technique.
    - **Privacy** and **security** of user data is essential.
- What should we consider when we collect users data?
    - We should consider **privacy** and **security**. Users’ data are prone to be stolen so you have to:
        - Collect data that you really need, avoid irrelevant data.
        - Make sure to not associate collected data with **PII** or **SPII**
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled.png)
            
        - Remove data once you don’t need it anymore.
- User Research Method : Survey.
    - Powerful way to gather **quick responses** in a **short time** from a **large number of users** (broad view).
    - Often **done online** and easily created.
    - **One of the cheapest** methods of user research.
    - Can be an **initial step** to gather general insights about users’ motivations, preferences, priorities, pain points, and its findings help in planning later activities such as interview.
    - Some people would suggest starting with interviews/usability study and conducting a survey after that so you can design the survey questions based on the findings you gathered from interviews/usability study.
    - Choosing between either would depend on the kind of task, users, and familiarity with users.
    - Tips for a good survey design.
        - **Keep it as small as possible** :
            - Asking too many questions affects response rate and reliability of data.
            - Minimum number of questions to get the data you need and know you will use. Avoid PII or SPII questions (check the toggle above) to privacy/security concerns.
        - **Be aware of bias**. Note that you may phrase questions inadvertently such that they lead the user to select specific answers.
        - **Feedback from participants about survey**. This means that you must consider questioning the user about the survey itself. Such questions like : were the questions clear? did you find the survey long or have unnecessary questions? etc.
    - How to ask good survey questions?
        - David Joyner suggests six characteristics while designing a survey. You have to be:
            - **Clear**.
                - You should pick words that are easily understandable to the users to avoid misinterpretation or confusion.
                - Survey questions differ from interview questions. Survey questions are most likely to be objective, short answer, multiple choice, etc. Whereas interview questions are open-ended questions so we can evaluate the candidate being interviewed.
                - Provide labels to clarify a numeric scale.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%201.png)
                    
                    - Ignoring labels will definitely lead to confusion. User may not correctly deduce whether 1 indicates highly dissatisfied or highly satisfied, or the user may not be able to distinguish between 1 and 2 since he/she doesn’t know the clear difference.
                - Avoid overlapping ranges.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%202.png)
                    
                    - Users will hesitate to choose the correct range.
                - When in doubt, provide extra detail.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%203.png)
                    
                    - Do all people know what tablet computer actually mean? This will also lead to confusion so you need to be more specific.
                - Timebox frequency based questions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%204.png)
                    
                    - Try to make these kind of questions quantized. Users won’t be able to distinguish the correct difference between Rarely/Occasionally/Frequently.
                    - You (the survey designer) can’t know what, for example, the “Occasionally” option implies, does it mean 3 or 2 times?
                    - Another thing to note here, you should ask the question in a specific timebox so the user can only recall the correct timebox. It should also be in the near past so users don't provide incorrect data due to forgetting.
                    - Quick quiz : There’s a problem in the last two choices, can you spot it ?
                        - Answer.
                            - Overlapping ranges.
            - **Concise**.
                - Ask questions in plain languages.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%205.png)
                    
                    - Avoid long, tedious, and verbose questions. Try to phrase your questions clearly and simply.
            - **Specific**.
                - Avoid questions on super-big ideas.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%206.png)
                    
                    - Interface is a large component that consists of smaller components.
                    - You have to be specific and ask, for example, on a specific aspect of the interface (responsiveness, quickness, colors, etc.).
                    - Briefly, avoid **general questions** and ask **specific questions**.
                - Avoid “double-barrel” questions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%207.png)
                    
                    - In this example, the above question asked about two different things in a single question.
                    - You should split questions with multiple parts into one question for each part.
                - Avoid questions that allow internal conflict.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%208.png)
                    
                    - Similar to above tip, we need to make the user specific about his feedback on the food. Therefore we have to be specific for each aspect of the food (appearance, flavor, temperature, etc.).
            - **Expressive**
                - Emphasize the user’s opinions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%209.png)
                    
                    - Try to focus on asking for user’s opinion. To do so, you can use question phrases like (do you think, do you feel, what’s your opinion about.. ?
                - Use ranges instead of yes/no questions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2010.png)
                    
                    - You can’t specify the frequency of user’s usage of, for example, a product by asking yes/no questions. Instead, try to provide ranges to gather meaningful answer.
                - Give levels of frequency of agreement.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2011.png)
                    
                    - Avoid white-black binary options, try to give more levels instead of only two.
                - Allow multiple selections when possible.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2012.png)
                    
                    - In questions that may have multiple answers, use checkboxes instead of radio boxes.
                - Allow users to add nominal categories.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2013.png)
                    
                    - There might be a possibility that a user may have an option that is not included in your options, so make sure to add “Other” option so users can include theirs.
            - **Unbiased**
                - Allow users to add nominal categories.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2013.png)
                    
                    - To avoid bias, you also have to include “Other” option so users can add their own option so they don’t have to stick with the options you’ve included.
                - Leave potentially open-ended questions open.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2014.png)
                    
                    - Having multiple choices for open-ended question will direct users for specific kinds of answers.
                    - It’s recommended to make a text field instead of traditional checkboxes.
                - Avoid leading questions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2015.png)
                    
                    - Using phrase like “brand-new” would lead the used to answer with positive response.
                    - Make sure to phrase your questions to be as neutral as possible to gain honest feedback.
                - Avoid loaded questions.
                    
                    ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2016.png)
                    
                    - In this example, you’ve add your own opinion to the question. You’ve assumed that people using social media are wasting their times.
                    - This will leads to answers with short periods (apparently users don’t want to feel that they’re wasting time).
            - **Usable**
                - Provide a progress bar.
                - Make your page lengths consistent.
                - Order your questions logically.
                - Alert users about unanswered questions.
                - Preview the survey yourself. You should try to fill the survey yourself and see if some questions are phrased incorrectly, survey is too long, or has other issues.
    - Exercises.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2017.png)
        
        - Answers.
            - First question doesn’t have any indication of rating 2 and 3, so labels are missing here. Try to make your scale small, don’t use big scales like 1-10 unless it’s really required, users can’t differentiate between values in big scales and you (survey designer) won’t provide labels for all values.
            - Second question may depend on the first one. Note that you’ve assumed here that the user already likes to exercise, but the user might have selected a low value like 1 on the first question, so questions are not ordered logically.
            - Third question is controversial, notice how the scale is flipped unlike the first questions. It’s important to **remember** that you have to make your **scale-based question consistent**.
            - Fourth question has two problems. The first is the yes/no question style is not expressive and the timeframe selected (this year) is really hard to remember.
                
                ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2018.png)
                
- User Research Method : Interviews
    - Although surveys may not be conducted, interviews are more a common research technique.
    - Allow for deeper and thorough understanding of users.
        - **More open-ended** and why questions (Joyner: Focus on 6 Ws - Why, what, when, who, where, How-).
        - Natural room for **follow-up questions**. Depending upon the users’ answers and body language, you can ask follow-up questions to understand further about his/her answers.
        - **Reflection on rare activities and events**. We can use usability studies to observe how our users use early versions of our system.
    - Much less number of users can be interviewed compared to surveys
    - More expensive
        - Synchronous: Interviewer devotes time to every interviewee. Interviewing more people means more time.
        - Incentives: Interviewed users often expect some compensation
    - **Interviews and surveys** can be done in sequence in **either order** (use results of one to plan the other).
    - Tips for good interview.
        - Plan ahead and prepare your questions before the interview time
        - During the interview, there are **two keys** for success :
            - **Listen well**, user should be talking most of the time
            - **Take notes**, a team with **one asking** and the **other taking notes** is a good option (audio recording is not enough). Notes about emotions, reactions, voice tone, etc. are important.
        - Leave some time between interviews. Try to not exhaust the team in conducting interviews sequentially.
        - A good book about interviewing is called “**Interviewing as Qualitative Research**”.
    - Interviewing Individuals vs. Groups.
        
        
        | Individual  | Groups |
        | --- | --- |
        | - More time/effort spent with each participant. | - Easier to solicit more feedback |
        | - Easier to coordinate the logistics. It’s easier to schedule an appointment with an individual than with a group of people. | - Participants’ discussion can highlight assumptions, etc. |
        | - More privacy for the participants. Talking among a group of people is not easy for some people. | - May need to deal with confounding personalities. Some people would lead the discussion and some people would stay silent during the whole interview. |
        |  | - “Presentation of self” issues. Some people will respond with ideal answers that most of the group agree on. |
        
- Challenges of data gathered by asking questions (survey or interviews).
    - To do research right, planning and preparation need time and effort, maybe more than available for design team.
    - **Analysis of qualitative** data is **not easy**.
    - Recall **bias is expected**.
        - Inaccurate responses about things happened in the past. Focus on asking about the recent past for a short timeframe (yesterday, last week, last month).
    - Reflection/reporting may be biased.
        - People tend to give answers more ideal than reality.
    - **Solution**: Use **with** other techniques such as participant observation, usability studies, secondary research, etc.
- User Research Method : Usability Studies.
    - Effective way to evaluate how easy can participant users complete core tasks in a design.
    - How many participants?
        - Five participant (Google recommendation)
        - Increasing the number may result in higher cost with minor additions
    - Often used with “**think-aloud**” technique.
    - Can be conducted **during the design** with the help of a prototype, or **after system** is implemented.
    - May be good to be followed by an interview with the participant to get better understanding of use experience.
    - **Types of usability studies**.
        - **Moderated** Usability Study : A moderator guides participants through the study in real time. The moderator’s goal is to help participants to interact with the product and gain their feedback along the way.
        - **Unmoderated** Usability Study : Participants test out the prototypes **without** human guidance. Usually the study is recorded as a video and the UX team reviews the video footage after the study.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%204%20-%20User%20Research%20Methods%20e5bf611610ca42bcbc319d9572b3978b/Untitled%2019.png)
        
        - To conduct the correct type, the UX team have to consider the scope and goals of the study as well as the type of participants your trying to reach.
    - **Use a spreadsheet to take notes.**
        - It’s a simple and easy method to keep your notes organized using a spreadsheet. Without spreadsheets, your note are unorganized and it’s hard to remember specific details.
        - You have to setup a structure of your spreadsheet which should contain categories for different observations you’re making. Note that you should have separate spreadsheet for each participant. Therefore, after creating the five categories, just duplicate the spreadsheet for each participant.
        - The five categories (recommended by Google’s course) are :
            - **Tasks** :
                - Must be the **first thing** to be filled before study beings.
                - It should also contain the tasks the user is about to accomplish and the user name.
            - **Click path**
                - The route the participant takes to complete a task during the study.
                - This helps in developing new insights about the user flow.
                - Check if the flow is intuitive to the user.
            - **Observations**
                - Here we note down behavior, opinion, and attitudes along with any errors, issues or areas of confusion.
            - **Quotes**.
                - Contains any significant quotes whether positive or negative.
                - Quotes like “I think I need a way to do a recurring booking for my dog” are included to this column.
            - **Task Completion**
                - We evaluate how easy was the task for the user to complete.
                - We assign 1 for easy, 2 for completed with difficulty, 3 for not completed.
