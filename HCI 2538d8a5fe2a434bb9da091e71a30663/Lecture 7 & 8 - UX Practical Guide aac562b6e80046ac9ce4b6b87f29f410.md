# Lecture 7 & 8 - UX Practical Guide

- Form Tips.
    - Important commands are displayed as buttons, not links.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled.png)
        
        - Buttons are more eye-catching than links.
        - However, **DON’T** display all commands as buttons.
    - Use progress bars or breadcrumbs.
        - Breadcrumbs defines **where users are.** Suitable with multiple choice or navigation in a website.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%201.png)
            
        - Progress bars defines **where users** are, and **what’s left to do**. Used for a predefined unique path in order to accomplish a task.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%202.png)
            
    - Show a confirmation page or dialog box when a form is successfully submitted
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%203.png)
        
        - It’s a good practice to show confirmation dialog or page to avoid confusion for the user so that the user is certain about the completion of the request.
    - Show error messages next to the input field where the error occurred.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%204.png)
        
    - Provide large text boxes for large inputs.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - Include field hints, examples, or required formats to make the expected input clear.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%206.png)
        
        - The red question button is used to show a floating popup to explain what does a field refer to.
        - You can also show some info when the mouse hovers on a field.
    - When a request fails in a form, DON’T clear the whole form. Load the same page with an error being highlighted on the wrong input field.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%207.png)
        
    - Make a clear distinction between primary and secondary calls-to-actions buttons.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%208.png)
        
        - As you can see, Go Pro button is highlighted and visually distinguished from Free Trial button.
        - Go Pro button is called primary call-to-action button whereas the other is called secondary call-to-action.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%209.png)
        
        - In this example, the benefits of premium subscription is highlighted so that the user can quickly scan what extra benefits he/she gets with premium subscription.
        - Get Premium button is the primary call-to-action so to encourage the user to subscribe.
    - Stick to a simple 3-color palette.
        - Combining more than 3 primary colors is difficult and it will often confuse your users.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2010.png)
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2011.png)
            
    - Make alert message consistent across your application.
        - Don’t use a different color, style or placement as it just becomes confusing.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2012.png)
            
        - Important thing to note here, you can have different looking alerts but with different meanings. You may have different styles for error alerts and warning alerts for example.
    - If an alert contains a single button, make it “close” button. If there’re two buttons, make one of them as action button and the other as “cancel” button not “close”.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2013.png)
        
        - Note that in English, set the cancel button be on the right.
    - Make error messages brief and specific.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2014.png)
        
        - Also try to pick a descriptive icons.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2015.png)
        
    - If you have any system notice (system update notification, policy changes, etc.) you should have three things→ **action button**, **remind me later button**, and **don’t show again box**.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2016.png)
        
- Layout Tips.
    - Make important information above the fold.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2017.png)
        
    - Related information is clearly grouped together.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2018.png)
        
        - Grouping helps in arranging a lot of content in a form without confusing the user.
    - In case you have a lot of items but some items are related to other items, then you can use colors to group and structure items on the page.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2019.png)
        
        - You can also use separators or spacing to isolate groups from each other.
        - You can define label colors for each group, or you may use different background colors for each group.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2020.png)
        
        - However, this method is a last resort. Having many groups would result in messy background colors.
    - Order related items logically.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2021.png)
        
        - Either way are okay, but second one looks nice because scanning from left to the right is more intuitive and easer than top to bottom.
    - Make your logo in the same place on every page.
        - In case you have a fixed navigation bar or app bar, you have to make sure that the logo is in the same place.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2022.png)
        
    - Make sure that you have consistent fonts across all pages.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2023.png)
        
    - Don’t make your background complicated or distracting users from interacting with the content.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2024.png)
        
- Navigation Tips.
    - Set clear call-to-action button to tell the user **what to do next**.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2025.png)
        
    - Add breadcrumb so that you can tell the user where they are on the site.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2026.png)
        
    - Make clear links to the Home page and categories on every page.
        - This is achievable by adding a navigation bar on each page to make your site more controllable.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2027.png)
            
    - Add navigation tabs at the top of the page.
        - Make sure that tabs are logically grouped and are listed on the **top**.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2028.png)
        
    - It’s nice to add visual effect (animation, font size change, underline, etc.) when the user hovers over something clickable.
        - This helps in distinguishing clickable elements from other elements in your site.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2029.png)
        
    - Company logo on the navigation bar must be clickable and refers to the home page.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2030.png)
        
    - What are red routes in UX?
        - The series of pages/actions that customers often use to complete task.
    - Expedia’s navigation case study.
        - We can define the red routes (series of actions) using user stories.
        - From user stories, you can define the heart of the task by focusing on important points.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2031.png)
            
        - So the points that we should emphasize when we design the UI are :
            - Define fields for leaving and destination places.
            - Define number of tickets needed.
            - Define the leaving and returning dates.
        - These are considered to be the most important points and should be shown first. Other information like seat number, flight class, etc. are also important but should not be shown first or have higher emphasis than the points defined above.
        - So you define the red routes (general routes) which all users have to follow and from each route you can spin off some extra options.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2032.png)
            
        - So as you can see, without scrolling you’re able to define the leaving and destination places and dates as well as specifying the number of travelers.
        - Analysis is important in defining the default options. It helps you in knowing that most people usually choose roundtrips rather than one-way.
    - Booking’s navigation case study.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2033.png)
        
        - Our red routes are :
            - Number of rooms.
            - Check-in and check-out dates.
        - As we previously stated, there’re other important information but these are the main information that we should include first.
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2034.png)
        
        - Booking’s analysis found out that most people reserve a room for 2 adults so the default option was set based on that.
        - Also you can provide multiple services in a single website like Booking. Also notice that these services are related to each other so you won’t need to leave the website to search for another service.
        - Furthermore, the default service choice was based on most service used on the website using analytics.
        - We can also use text auto-complete feature to help the user finding the correct city or country.
        - The main point is to minimize the amount of effort to navigate through red routes.
    - Notion’s navigation case study.
        - Notion suggests two different usage paths so that it can recommend its specific services to individuals or users.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2035.png)
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2036.png)
            
    - Khan Academy’s navigation case study.
        - Khan Academy has got courses for all levels. Defining your level helps in making your navigation seamless.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2037.png)
            
        - There’re also shortcuts for most common tasks (which can be known via user research !) which definitely helps the user in navigating easily around the app.
        - Users can define their level and interests to Khan Academy so that it can help the user recommending courses.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2038.png)
            
        - Notice that the number of steps is provided and the type of courses is shown based on user’s level.
        - There’s a little con here, it would be nice if the user can initially skip the personalization prompts.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2039.png)
            
        - You can see some nice features:
            - Navigating between courses.
            - Edit the courses.
            - Edit the account.
            - Jump to the course directly.
    - YouTube’s upload feature navigation case study.
        - YouTube’s define its red routes as series of steps to successfully upload a video.
        - It’s worth to note that due to YouTube’s policy, steps cannot be skipped such as defining a video title, specifying audience age group, etc.

- Content Tips.
    - Expose content in multiple dimensions using :
        - Grouping.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2047.png)
            
            - In case you have big content to show, you have to:
                - Be sure to split your content into groups.
                - Make grouping choices available horizontally rather than click on a combo box (dropdown menu).
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2048.png)
            
            - Note here that filtering options are also grouped using What, Where, and When labels.
            - You can also include the same filtering process on the search box. This may be repetitive from filtering button but users may not notice the button or they typically use the search box directly.
            
            ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2049.png)
            
            - A good rule of thumb ⇒ Large content should be divided into groups.
        - Color Coding.
            - You can refer to information using colors. You should make sure that the data that refer to the colors are intuitive. So green may be considered as highly rated, orange for moderate and red for low or bad.
                
                ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2050.png)
                
        - Mouse Hover.
            - You can display more data when an item is being hovered by a mouse.
                
                ![Untitled](Lecture%207%20&%208%20-%20UX%20Practical%20Guide%20aac562b6e80046ac9ce4b6b87f29f410/Untitled%2051.png)
                
                - As you can see, rather than click on the city to show its details, you can just hover on the card to see a quick overview.
        - Multi-Tabs.
            - You can also provide more info about the city using tabs. Each tab itself has its own content so each tab should contain relevant data to the tab name.

- UX KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
    - It’s about defining the success of our UI/UX design.
    - It consists of two types :
        - Behavioral UX KPIs.
            - We make a useability study by giving a sample of users a task and measure :
                - **Task success rate**: Did the user successfully managed to finish the task?
                - **Time-on-task**: The time spent on finishing the task.
                - **Search vs navigation**: Did the user use search because navigation is unclear or used navigation?
                - **User error rate**: Rate of errors the user made during working on the task.

        - Attitudinal UX KPIs.
            - Metrics used to measure **subjective experience and perception** of users towards a product or service.
            - They are focused on understanding **customers' attitudes**, **emotions**, and **opinions** towards a particular **product** or **service**.
            - Attitudinal UX KPIs are typically measured through **user surveys**, **interviews**, and **feedback**.
            - Examples of Attitudinal UX KPIs include:
                - **Net Promotor Score** (**NPS**): A metric that measures the likelihood of customers recommending a product or service to others.
                - **Customer Satisfaction** (**CSAT**): A metric that measures the overall satisfaction level of users with a product or service.
                - **System Usability Scale** (**SUS**): A metric that measures the user’s experience using a couple of questions and each answer is a scale from 1 to 5.
                - **Emotional Response**: A metric that measures the emotional impact of a product or service on users.
                - **User Engagement**: A metric that measures the level of user interaction and involvement with a product or service.
