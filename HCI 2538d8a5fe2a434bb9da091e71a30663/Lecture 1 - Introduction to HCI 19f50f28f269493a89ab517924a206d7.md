# Lecture 1 - Introduction to HCI.

- What is HCI ?
    - HCI stands for **Human-Computer Interaction**.
    - It’s a **multidisciplinary** field.
    - HCI is about the knowledge we need to know in order to design **computerized systems** whose ********************users (humans)******************** can get the maximum benefit from the system with ease.
    - It also involves :
        - **The study of humans** (needs, abilities, limitations, etc.).
        - **The study of computer technologies** that can enhance the interaction between the user and computers (from keyboard and mouse to using voice assistant to interact with computers with voice).
        - **The study of ways**, **preferences**, **difficulties** faced by users of current or past systems.
- Why do we bother ourselves with studying HCI ?
    - The concepts that you’ll learn in this course will help you in enhancing your **critical thinking** while using various interfaces of any kind of applications.
    - This experience will help you in **designing your own products**.
- HCI resources used in this course.
    - David Joyner’s [Edx course](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-human-computer-interaction?index=undefined).
    - Scott Klemmer [Coursera’s specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design).
    - Minnesota’s [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/user-interface-design).
    - Google’s UX [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design).
- What should we be concerned with when designing an interface of a system ?
    - We should interact with **human senses** and **experiences**.
- Does “I” in HCI stands for **interface** or **interaction** ?
    - **Interaction** is more general than Interface.
    - Interface may refer to designing only I/O devices, voice-input devices, etc. which is just a part of the whole interaction between the user and the computer.
- Where does HCI locate in the hierarchy of fields?

    - As you can see, **Human Factors Engineering** is a merged field from **Engineering** and **Psychology**. It’s concerned with any type of products and not necessarily computer products. Taking a chair as an example, the dimensions of the chair are important as it makes the experience for the user sitting (aka interacting) on it as comfortable as possible.
    - HCI is just a branch of Human Factors Engineering which is also ramified to UX, UI, and Interaction (Joyner’s Opinion). Some other people make UX a broader discipline and UI a branch of it.
- What is Human Factors Engineering ?
    - It’s about **designing interactions** between people and products, systems, or devices.
- What is the difference between **Human Factors Engineering** and HCI ?
    - If the system or the product mentioned in **HFE** is a computerized system then it’s HCI.
    - Note that the gap between both are shrinking because more devices are becoming computerized nowadays.
- What is the difference between HCI, UX, and UI ?

- What’s the difference between past and today’s software ?
    - In the past, machines were expensive so software engineers were focused on designing efficient software (usability wasn’t a main concern).
    - Today, machines becomes cheaper so the success of a computer system requires the design to be **user-centric**, focused on **usability**, and **smooth user experience**.
- Do we interact with the computer or the task through the computer?
    - A user of a system is trying to **achieve some task** through the system you’ve designed.
    - So in reality, the user **interacts with the task**.
    - Taking Zoom as an example, the main task is to have a meeting with the host and not to interact with the device or the Zoom program itself. Zoom is just a **mean** to achieve that task.
- What might be the metrics for a successful interface?
    - A successful interface should provide a **smooth experience** so that the user who is interacting with the task would forget about the system interface.
    - A successful interface should be as **invisible** as possible.
- What’s the point of making our interfaces invisible?

- What are the **three main components** of UI design process?
    - The three components (not phases) are :
        - **User Research**.
        - **Design and prototyping of the interface**.
        - **User interface evaluation (improvement).**
- Discuss further about the user research step in UI design process.
    - This is a crucial step that is might be abandoned by SWEs with no experience or have no well-established foundation.
    - In user research, we have to learn about two important things :
        - **********Users********** who will use your system (their skills, possible distractions, special needs as kids, elderly people with disabilities).
        - **Tasks** that users try to complete through the system.
    - We should also learn from **previous researches** done about human capabilities, limitations, and how people perceive things.
- **Case Study** - Design a search feature of an online book library.

    - So now we’re trying to design a search feature. We should have a search box and a search type dropdown menu.
    - The dropdown menu should contain searching by title, author, publisher, subject, release date, or category.
    - This is a general UI for online library, now we’re targeting a kids library. What adjustments should we add to the UI ?

    - This is a bad design as user research component (first one) is absent, we’ve just colored the previous design.
    - We can add voice-assistant, search by age-group, or filter with pictorial categories.
    - Did we actually achieve the user research correctly? We’ve been brainstorming. To make our user research complete, how about involving the users (kids)?
    - A good example of involvement was done in University of Maryland’s HCI lab in which they asked children to help the professors with the design (children as **design partners**).
        
        ![Untitled](Lecture%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20HCI%2019f50f28f269493a89ab517924a206d7/Untitled%205.png)
        
    - This is the design that was done by HCIL (Human-Computer Interaction Lab) in Maryland.

    - The search page has many cool features like searching for a book using its color or the size of the book.

    - Recall the third component was “**design evaluation**”, you can’t actually evaluate a design just by guessing or asking individuals, so you need to collect data to have a compelling evidence about the design evaluation.
    - You can use **services** that keeps track of user interaction with UI components.
- What have you learned from the previous case?
    - A good designer works to **understand** the issues from the user’s point of view.
    - Work with **users** rather than guess what they like.
