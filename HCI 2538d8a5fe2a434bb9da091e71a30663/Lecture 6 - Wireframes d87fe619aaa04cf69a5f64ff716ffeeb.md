# Lecture 6 - Wireframes.

- Why would we study design? Are we trying to push you towards UI/UX opportunities ?
    - Most courses in CSE or CS focus on enhancing the students' development skills.
    - No, we’re not pushing you towards design jobs, instead we recommend development jobs.
    - The reason for that is the complexity for implementing a design requires a lot of software engineers.
    - A team (in a startup) may include a single UI/UX designer but multiple developers to implement a system.
    - However, this course helps you in exploring the design field which will be helpful to communicate easily and work better with designers to ultimately understand the design process.
    - Some students with talent and skills, will **shine** more as designers not developers.
    - Some developers/software engineers will **typically** do the design work besides the regular development when no designers exist in their companies/teams.
- Assume working in a big company that have two separate teams for development and design, define the two methods followed to design and develop a system.
    - **Handoff** process (sequential or traditional process) is to finish the whole design first and then start development.

    - **Handshake** process which is more modern and better method to design and develop a system. Both developers and designers are interacting and communicating continuously to refine the design and the implementation.

- What is the objective for this lecture?
    - Good design process: several alternatives and iterations
    - Designers use prototypes to share design alternatives with colleagues and stakeholders and to get constructive feedback.
    - Design process is an iterative process, designers go through a series of iterations and from low fidelity prototypes to high fidelity prototypes until they reach a final design.
    - The **focus** of this lecture is to discuss a commonly used form of low fidelity prototypes called **wireframes**.
    - Google team considered it “key part of the design process”.
- What is a wireframe?
    - A wireframe is a **schematic** for basic outline of a screen in a system.
    - Built using lines and basic shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) with some text (lines look as if made of wire).
    - Intentionally has no colors, fonts, styles to focus on structure.
    - A wireframe is considered to be a lo-fi design because we don’t define too much details like spacing, text size, etc. We’re concerned with the UI’s elements arrangement.
    - Wireframe = skeleton with placeholders.

- Do we consider wireframes as an artistic drawing?
    - Quoting from google: “A good wireframe is **not about artistic drawing**, it is all about organizing and communicating information clearly to colleagues”.
- What is the purpose of a wireframe?
    - Helps decisions about basic structure of a page before visual considerations like colors or images are added.
    - **Gets team** on **the same page** early in the project and saves **time** and **resources**.
    - **Directs stakeholders** and **users** to give **feedback** at the right level (feedback about structure and function without being distracted by visual aspects like colors and typography).
    - **Early catching** of problems resulting from forgetting an element or disorganized element.
- When should we create a wireframe?
    - Should be done after foundational user research.
    - As soon as we have an initial site map (content hierarchy).

- What are industry standards for wireframes?
    - Text represented by horizontal lines or placeholder text such as “**Lorem ipsum**”.
    - Images represented by rectangles or circles with X.
    - Calls of action represented by rectangles or circles.
    - **Proper annotation** with text to make the wireframe **clear**.

- How to create a wireframe?
    - Start with **pen** and **paper.**
    - Remember **first goal**: **Reaching** a design not showing a design.
    - For each screen, sketch **alternative** wireframe versions.
        - “at least 5 versions”.
    - Go through some **iterations** with feedback if available.
    - Remember second goal: A wireframe **transfers** an idea from your **mind** to **paper** as **quickly** and as **easily** as possible. That’s why paper wireframes are recommended as a first step.
    - **No focus on details** that slow the process such as straight lines, spacing, and alignment in this stage.
    - After paper wireframe, you can thereafter use digital tools to create digital wireframe using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Balsamiq, Pencil, etc.
- Wireframing example (dog walking app).
    - Google’s course on Coursera shows a design case for a dog walking app.
    - They provided 5 wireframes as they suggested for the homepage of the app.
    - These are some highlights on the wireframes :
        - 1 : As you can see the design includes a search bar as well as the profiles of each person you can hire as cards in a grid.
        - 2: This design shows a carousel for providing tips for the users and the profiles are shown as a list view.
        - 3: Similar to 2 but shows the recent activates the user has done and a more specific list view of profiles that are near to the user.

    - Very crucial to note that these designs may not be made parallelly but instead progressively. So in the first two wireframes, it’s not clear how profiles are sorted and shown to the users, are they sorted based on rating? price?
    - So a feedback may be received and consequently the third wireframe is an enhancement based on that. Also note that the text (dog walkers near you) is annotated as it as because we want to be **very clear** about the basis on which the profiles are shown and sorted.
