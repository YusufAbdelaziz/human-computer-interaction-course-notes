# Lecture 5 - Prototyping.

- Remember & Lecture Overview.
    - There are three major components of the design process.
    - We focused on user research in the previous lecture.
    - Now we’ll start on talking about **Design and Prototyping**.
        - We want to enhance the way we think of designing.
- Can normal people design interfaces ?
    - Quoting from Scott Klemmer (UCSD Lab): “Designing **great** UIs require **enormous creativity** and **a lot of hard work …….**”.
    - Joyner said that **design is very hard**.
    - Therefore, typically a big percentage of learners are not confident that they can design.
    - In designing, there’re techniques, methods and principles that everyone can learn and apply. However, there’s still some portion of creativity needed to conduct a **great** UI and some people are gifted with that ability.
    - Note that we’re not teaching art nor creativity in this course.
    - The quote above is the half of what Scott said. The other half is:  “ but designing pretty **good user interfaces** is actually **pretty easy** if you know some basic **methods**, **techniques**, and **principles**”
- Should we be eager for great UI when designing a system?
    - It’s of course desirable to produce a great UI, but as we said earlier, not all people are gifted with creativity.
    - Therefore we shouldn’t focus on perfection and just satisfy the system’s requirements with a **good** user interface.
    - Our main goal is to design useable interface and the user can achieve tasks. Recall that the design should be **invisible** and the user shouldn’t focus too much on the UI**.**
- Takeaways from previous toggles.
    - Design work does not result in wall hanging artwork
    - HCI and UX Designers keep sending a message “We are **not artists**, in most cases, we are not even talented in art and drawing”
    - Learners with talent and creativity have a big advantage, don’t turn off creativity and just follow tips and guidelines, don’t commit biggest mistakes of design!
    - Be aware that some creative people may deviate from a usable design and focus on good-looking design.
- Biggest mistakes a designer can make (According to Joyner).
    - Biggest mistake: Jumping straight to designing an interface **without understanding** the **users** or understanding the **task**
    - Second biggest mistake: Settling on a **single design idea** or a **single genre** of design ideas **too early.**
    - Recall that Joyner has separated the design component into two different components which were **Design Alternatives** and **Prototyping**.

    - This means that you should **not** focus too strongly on one alternative from the very beginning.
    - To reach a good design: Explore a wider range of possible **design alternatives**.
- Why do we need multiple design alternatives ? why can’t we stick with only one design ?
    - Having only one design makes you **captured** by that design features especially for an existing system. A single design has its own limitations and may not have the ability to extend/add features.
    - A thermostats is a good example of sticking with a design of existing system.
    - As you can see, on the left is the traditional thermostat interface design. Some companies decided to enhance the design and come up with more design alternatives.
    - The left design has a lot of info to display in a small-sized screen which may leave the user with frustration. The design on the right is more simpler and usable to the user.

    - Joyner’s advice : “Try to **distance yourself** from the existing solutions, at least initially during the **brainstorming** sessions”.
    - So you must first have multiple design alternatives and don’t initially focus on existing systems to copy their UI. After doing user research and come up with multiple design alternatives, you may take a look on existing systems for evaluation.
    - Success in having several alternatives is important in the early stages of the design
    - It may be the case that you later choose one of the alternatives and finalize it for your product.
    - However, it is more common that the final design is some combination of the design alternatives you explored earlier.
    - But how many alternatives are good? As much as you can.
    - Taking Microsoft’s first mouse as an example, they’ve made more than 100 prototypes so they can come up with a good mouse design. Note that they might’ve created a new final design and discarded the 100 prototypes, however, these prototypes were helpful in building the final design.

- What is a prototype ?
    - For most people: A prototype is a quick/small version of the real thing
    - This is not a useful understanding of what a prototype is
    - If that is everything, prototyping would not have been that important in the design process.
    - The prototype is mainly intended to collect a user’s **feedback** quickly.
    - Some quotes about prototyping :
        - For designers: “Rapidly creating an approximation of a design so that you can quickly get feedback”
        - Klemmer: “Prototype is not about the artifact, its about **feedback** and **iteration**”
        - Joyner: “The design process as a whole is an **iterative process** of brainstorming, combining, abandoning, revising, and improving your ideas, and that requires you **start with several ideas in the first place**”
- What is a good prototype ?
    - Quoting from Klemmer: “Good prototype is a one that enables you to get **useful feedback** and **iterate** on your design, not a one that resembles your final product”.
    - Some people use the **constructive** instead of **useful** when we describe a feedback. We want people that are evaluating our prototype to talk about the problems they have faced and provide suggestions to enhance the prototype.
    - It’s worth to note that the final product shouldn’t be similar to the prototype. This means that the prototype is intended to be enhanced based on user’s feedback, shouldn’t be left as it is.
    - Prototypes are meant to give you **new knowledge**. Klemmer said: “If you are making prototypes that don't give you **new knowledge**, you're really wasting your design process”.
    - Klemmer: “Prototypes are questions, ask a lot of them”.
- Prototypes as a communication method.
    - Prototypes serve as a way to communicate with stakeholders
    - Prototypes serve four distinct audiences:
        - Colleagues → Discuss your ideas using prototypes instead of verbal communication.
        - Clients
        - Users
        - Yourself → You start to evaluate your decisions wisely when you interact with the prototype by itself.
    - Recall that user research appears during the whole design process and prototypes helps in collecting user’s feedback (usability study) via prototypes.
- What is prototype fidelity ? What is the difference between a low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes ?
    - Fidelity is **how closely a design** **matches** the look and feel of the **final product**.
    - A low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype is similar to wireframes and it doesn’t look like the final product and needs too much work.
    - A high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype is generated by tools that make it realistic and resemble the final product.
- Which type of prototypes should we start with ?
    - We should always start with low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype and as we proceed, we produce higher fidelity prototypes.
- Why don’t we just use tools and start with generating high-fidelity prototypes?
    - It may be obvious that lo-fi prototypes are **faster**, **easier**, and **cheaper** to generate
    - It is also clear that hi-fi prototypes cannot be easy at the beginning as we don’t make the decisions about many details of the system
    - But, one more **strong reason** to use lo-fi prototypes:
        - ***People are much more willing to talk when given a sketch than when given something that look finished.***
    - Konstan (Uni. Of Minnesota): “Some studies have shown that when you give somebody a prototype that looks like it didn't take a lot of effort, like hand drawn, it elicits more **significant constructive feedback**”.
    - Including many details may cause people to give feedback at a lower level than needed in the design.
    - Google: “Early in the design process, present high level ideas to stakeholders. Later on, focus on the details and practicalities like screens of an app”.
- What are the benefits of design activities that may not make sense ?
    - Generally speaking, any big company or academic HCI people that are doing such activities have their own reasons to do so which is ultimately beneficial to the design process.
    - Every design activity either (or both):
        - Helps the designer think and visualize.
        - Helps team members and other stakeholders visualize and communicate each other’s ideas.
    - Taking an activity as an example : Making use of the user research results to divide the users into personas, and each persona has its own representative character including a name for the character and an image for him/her. So rather than mentioning the specialties of a common group of people, we can simply mention the representative character which is less verbose and helpful in communication between teammates.
- What is brainstorming ? Should we start with individual brainstorming or group brainstorming ?
    - Brainstorming is an activity to generate a lot of ideas.
    - Joyner: “Research generally indicates it is better to start with individual brainstorming”.
    - “Brainstorming is most effective when it initially generates a lot of ideas, but groups tend to coalesce around ideas pretty early”.
    - So, a team should not start a group brainstorming session before each member has his own initial set of ideas.
- Tips for effective brainstorming.
    - Write down as many ideas as you can
    - Each idea is just few words or a sentence
    - “Aim for 20”, don’t stop before you have 20 ideas
    - Don’t evaluate or exclude any idea; an idea may be infeasible, very expensive, unusual, funny, etc.
    - Take breaks, or more than a session until having enough ideas
    - Team session(s) follow to share ideas and add new ones not to evaluate and narrow choices
