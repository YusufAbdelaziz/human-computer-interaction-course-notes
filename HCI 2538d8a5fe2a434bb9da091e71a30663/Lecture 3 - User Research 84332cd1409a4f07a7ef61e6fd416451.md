# Lecture 3 - User Research.

- Things to remember.
    - User research is a major component of a successful design process.
    - We said that we must understand users and their tasks and involve users to **base design decisions on reality** no guessing and assumptions.
    - Unfortunately, user research component is commonly ignored by designers.
    - Technical people - like us - are concerned with designing a system that meet some functional specifications without caring that much about real user needs.
    - However, we should embrace a user-centered design which takes into consideration the user’s needs at every step.
- What are we going to do in this lecture?
    - We’ll try to highlight user research **categories** (**types**) and **common methods** to make the user research activities more clear.
- Design life cycle according to Joyner.
    - As mentioned in the course’s materials, David Joyner is a lecturer who’s teaching a course on Udacity/edX.
    - Joyner mentioned that the design life cycle consists of an iterative process with four phases:
        - Needfinding.
        - Design Alternatives.
        - Prototyping.
        - Evaluation.

        - So where’s “user research” ? Some people use different terminology from others. Joyner is not trying to discard the term or saying that “**user research**” is not an essential step.
        - We might think that “**Needfinding**” as an alternative term to “**user research**”. However, using it as a synonymous is not **accurate**, understanding user needs is a **major part** of user research but not user research per se.
        - Also note that the second component (which was **Design and Prototyping**) is split into two separate phases according to Joyner.
- User-centered design process according to Google.
    - Google’s specialization on Coursera defines that the design process consists of four steps

    - Note that the pic above may indicate that the process is only sequential. This is true, but the process is also iterative, so when evaluation is done, we’re repeat the process again.
    - Note that “user research” isn’t explicitly stated as a step. However, the first two steps represents “user research”.
- Why scholars like Joyner and practitioners like Google UX designers don’t mention user research explicitly ?
    - They, of course, know the value of user research.
    - They don’t give the name to a separate phase/step because :
        - They consider it an **integral part** of each phase/step.
        - They want to avoid the **premature view** of user research as a step in the beginning of the design process.
        - User research never ends.

- Why should we set user research as an explicit component ?
    - Because it’s a crucial component that some may underestimating or ignoring it.
    - Important in light of the reality that it stands as a clear **role** in the UX Design more and more carried by specialized professionals
- Who do UI/UX design in typical companies ?
    - For startups, you’ll typically find that a software engineer will be associated with UI/UX design tasks as he/she is responsible for designing the whole system.
    - For small to medium companies, there’s a separate role called UI/UX designer who’s part of the development team. He/she’s a specialized person who’s carrying out all the interface development phase.
    - For large companies (like Google), there’re more specialized roles in UI/UX fields like [UX researcher](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-ux-researcher-how-to-get-the-job), [UX Designer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-ux-designer-do), [Visual Designer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/visual-designer), [UX Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-a-ux-engineer), etc.
- User research type as hierarchy.

- Define the types of user research based on “when”.
    - **Foundational (Strategic/generative) research.**
        - Takes place before anything is designed.
        - Goal to identify user problems and what should we build to solve them.
        - Involves talking with users and identify their pain points. This may happen by asking users from other similar systems.
        - “reveals opportunities no one in design team would come up with” quoted from Google’s course.
    - **Tactical (design) research.**
        - Takes place during the design phase
        - Goal to inform how product/system should be built
        - Requires user feedback through use of a prototype
    - **Post-launch research.**
        - Did we succeed? Does the system meet user needs?
- Define the types of user research based on “who”.
    - **Primary research.**
        - Research that you conduct **yourself**.
        - Common methods:
            - **Interviews** : Researcher does 1-on-1 interview with the user. This usually requires a lot of time and may require money. Note that interviewing questions have some rules to follow (avoiding yes/no questions, short answers, etc.) so we can come up with useful user feedback.
            - **Focus Groups** : Researcher gather users in a single room so users can share their insights about their own/common use cases.
            - **Surveys** : Printed or digital forms, intended to collect large data from users.
            - **Usability Studies :** A user is asked to do a specific task under the observation of a researcher.
            - **Participant Observations** : Similar to the usability study but we go out and see real user using the system without asking them to do a specific task for us.
    - **Secondary research**.
        - Research done by **someone else**.
        - Common sources of information (books, journals, articles).
        - Important especially early in the project to gather useful statistics, facts, figures, etc. about the users.
        - If such information exists, it saves enormous effort and time and backs up primary research findings.
        - Secondary research findings are usually done by experienced and specialized researchers in credible research organizations and difficult for you to replicate.
        - Many practitioners are not aware or don’t know how to benefit from available information relevant to their project users.
        - You can gain more knowledge about UX and HCI by :
            - Learning from courses on things like psychology, cognition, etc.
            - Join HCI/UX communities like in Dribbble, Behance, or Medium.
        - Benefits

            - Secondary research can help in understanding human abilities (interaction with external world causes and input that’s processed to produce an output).
            - An example of making use of other researches is building a color-blind-friendly website. Rather than observing the colors that interleave with each other to avoid them, we can know that in advance using other researchers’ findings/research.
            - Knowing the fact that more men have color blind than women, you can decide based on the gender of the user whether you care about colors for these users or not.
            - Can help know answers to questions about user groups with common issues and similar problems.
            - Example: Design an application that will be used by people in a poor country where it is more likely that users have low-end devices.
            
        - A **disadvantage** to consider is that there’s no way to collect direct feedback from your users
- Define the types of user research based on “what”.
    - **Quantitative research** :
        - Involves data of numeric nature.
        - Examples: Measures and counts.
        - Easier for engineers and technical people to handle.
    - **Qualitative research** :
        - Focuses on observations about **why and how things happen**.
        - Often based on **interviews**.
        - Qualitative analysis is more difficult for technical people but it is what we need for real understanding.
